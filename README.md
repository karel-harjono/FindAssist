# Context-Aware Voice Search for Document Exploration

## Project Overview
Voice Agents (VAs) are becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives, but they often face challenges with rigidity and limited contextual awareness during hands-free and focus-intensive activities. Our project introduces a novel technique that enhances document search capabilities within voice-based systems. This technique enables context-aware keyword searches through voice commands, combining semantic understanding with the conversational capabilities of VAs.

## Key Features
- **Context-Aware Keyword Searches**: Allows users to perform searches that are contextually relevant to their ongoing tasks.
- **Semantic Understanding**: Integrates semantic analysis to understand the intent behind user queries, ensuring more accurate search results.
- **Enhanced Conversational Capabilities**: Improves the interactive experience by enabling more natural and fluid dialogues with the voice agent.
- **Focus on Usability**: Designed to enhance user efficiency and satisfaction during focus-intensive tasks like reading or cooking.

## Implementation
The project is built using a combination of advanced search algorithms and voice interaction technologies. We utilize state-of-the-art NLP tools for semantic understanding and integrate these with popular voice recognition APIs to create a seamless user experience.

## Evaluation
Our evaluation demonstrates significant improvements in usability and task performance. We conducted a series of user studies to measure the impact of our technology on real-world document exploration tasks, the results of which are detailed in our project documentation.
