Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) v20.12.2
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) 10.7.0
- install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) from AppStore or Android PlayStore

You can confirm Node and npm versions by running:

npm -v
```
